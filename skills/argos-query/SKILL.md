# Argos Query Skill

Search Argos logs in four modes: centralized search, local file search, logID query, and error analysis.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- search service logs by keyword
- search service logs by PSM, with or without keywords
- inspect a service's local file logs
- trace a request by `logid`
- aggregate and summarize error logs

## Hard Rules

1. If the result depends on `vregion` and the user did **not** specify it, **ask first**. Do not guess.
2. Before a scope-bound call, normalize the mode, `vregion`, env/PPE intent, and either `time_range` or absolute `start`/`end`.
3. Do **not** probe multiple regions one by one to see which one returns logs.
4. Use multi-region queries only when the user explicitly asked for multiple regions.
5. Prefer `time_range` over raw timestamps unless the user explicitly gave an absolute time window.
6. `total: 0` is not a reason to silently switch `vregion`, `env`, or mode; re-check the original scope before retrying.

## Four Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Typical use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Central Search | `psm` with optional `keywords` / `log_level` | Search centralized service logs |
| Local File | `psm` + any of `env`, `env_type`, `path` | PPE / instance-local log inspection |
| LogID Query | `logid` | Trace one request across services |
| Error Analysis | `psm` + `aggregator` | Aggregate top error sources |

## Quick Start

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '<json_params>'
```

## First-Read Checklist

1. Select one mode from the Four Modes table.
2. Bind required scope: `vregion`, env/PPE intent, and time window.
3. Run the smallest matching example below with the bound scope.
4. Use the Bounded Recovery Ladder once if the call fails.
5. Close with the Final Answer Checklist.

## Quick Decision Index

| User request mentions | Go to |
|-----------------------|-------|
| service logs, keyword, error string | Central search examples |
| PPE, env, pod, local path | Local file example |
| `logid`, trace, request id | LogID query example |
| top errors, location, summary | Error analysis example |

## High-Frequency Examples

### 1. Central search without keywords

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '{
  "psm": "my.service.name",
  "vregion": "China-North",
  "time_range": "2h"
}'
```

Use this for the common "查这个服务最近一段时间的日志" case.

### 2. Keyword search

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '{
  "psm": "my.service.name",
  "keywords": ["timeout"],
  "vregion": "US-East",
  "time_range": "1h"
}'
```

Use this for the common "查这个服务最近有没有 timeout/error 日志" case.

### 3. Keyword search with log level

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '{
  "psm": "my.service.name",
  "keywords": ["error"],
  "log_level": "Error",
  "vregion": "Singapore-Central",
  "time_range": "30m"
}'
```

Use this when the user wants a narrower error-focused scan.

### 4. Local file search

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '{
  "psm": "desrpc.stability.thrift_server",
  "vregion": "US-East",
  "env": "ppe_desrpc_test",
  "env_type": "ppe",
  "time_range": "3h"
}'
```

Use this for PPE verification or when the user clearly wants instance-local logs.

### 5. Query by logID

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '{
  "logid": "021772604201988fdbddc55000210240c40819c720000d18743a7",
  "vregion": "Singapore-Central",
  "scan_span_in_min": 30
}'
```

Use this to trace a single request.

### 6. Error analysis

```bash
gdpa-cli run argos-query --session-id "$SESSION_ID" --input '{
  "psm": "desrpc.test.client",
  "aggregator": "location",
  "vregion": "EU-TTP2",
  "time_range": "1h"
}'
```

Use this for "Top error location / summary" style questions.

## Common Inputs

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `psm` | most modes | Required for central search, local file, error analysis |
| `logid` | logID mode | Switches to trace query mode |
| `keywords` | central search | Optional array of search strings |
| `aggregator` | error analysis | Common value: `location` |
| `vregion` | usually yes | Ask user when missing and region matters |
| `time_range` | no | Prefer this over timestamps |
| `env`, `env_type`, `path` | local file only | Explicitly switches to local file mode |
| `scan_span_in_min` | logID mode | Search-back window in minutes; values above the Argos backend max are clamped to 30 and reported via `effective_scan_span_in_min` + `warning` |

## Region Guidance

- If the user gave a `vregion`, use it exactly.
- If the user wants multi-region results, use only the named regions.
- If the user did not provide a region and the answer could vary by region, ask:
  - "这个日志要查哪个 vregion？"
  - "如果要多 region，对比范围请明确给我。"
- Do not retry with `sg`, `us`, `euttp2` in sequence.
- After any fallback, verify the same `vregion`, env, and time window are still in the next call and final answer.

## Mode Selection Guidance

- Prefer **Central Search** for general service log queries, with or without keywords.
- Prefer **Local File** only when PPE / env / path matters, and make that intent explicit in the input.
- Prefer **LogID Query** when the user already has a `logid`.
- Prefer **Error Analysis** when the user wants a summary, not raw logs.

## Bounded Recovery Ladder

When an Argos call fails or returns unusable data, recover in this order:

1. Fix local argument errors once, using the error text and the normalized scope.
2. Retry once on the same mode and scope when Argos gives recoverable constraint feedback.
3. If auth, permission, timeout, or zero-result state remains, report that state with the attempted scope and evidence.
4. Use another mode only when the user request already names that mode's required inputs.

## Output Expectations

Before the final answer, verify that the answer covers the user's requested scope,
the evidence returned by Argos, every requested dimension, and any dimension that
could not be obtained.

### Central Search

Returns matching logs with content snippets and total hit count.

### Local File

Returns pod-level local log lines for the chosen `env` / `path`.

### LogID Query

Returns expanded trace log lines. `total` counts expanded `data.items[].value[]` log lines, while `trace_group_total` keeps the original outer trace group count. Each expanded line keeps PSM, pod, IP, env, IDC, level, message, and permission context; `trace_groups` preserves group context even when a group has no visible `value[]` rows.

LogID queries include `requested_scan_span_in_min`, `effective_scan_span_in_min`, and `scan_span_in_min` (effective value). If a caller asks for more than the Argos backend-safe 30-minute window, the query is limited to 30 minutes and the result includes `scan_span_limited: true` plus a `warning`; carry that partial-scope signal into the final answer.

### Error Analysis

Returns aggregated error items such as top code locations, counts, and sampled messages.

### Final Answer Checklist

- State the queried `psm` or `logid`, `vregion`, environment when relevant, and time window; for LogID mode, state the effective scan span and any `scan_span_limited` warning.
- Carry forward the result status, hit count, and `finished` / partial-scan signal when present.
- Answer every requested dimension, including region, env, keyword, log level, error location, sample message, or trace context.
- If Argos returned no data or a field was unavailable, say which dimension is unobtainable and what evidence supports that.

## Defaults and Caveats

- `time_range` defaults differ by mode; check the reference file when precision matters.
- `start` / `end` use different units in Central Search vs Local File mode. Prefer `time_range`.
- `total: 0` often means wrong `vregion` or `env`, not necessarily "no logs exist".
- This skill is read-only.
